# Decision Trees for Drug Classification

This project uses a **Decision Tree Classifier** to classify drug prescriptions based on patient information. The model is implemented using Python and scikit-learn, with the dataset including features like age, gender, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels to predict the type of drug a patient should be prescribed.

## Project Overview

The notebook demonstrates how to:
- Preprocess categorical data using `LabelEncoder`.
- Split data into training and testing sets.
- Build a Decision Tree Classifier using the **entropy** criterion.
- Evaluate the model's performance.
